# QA inventory

## Required user-visible behavior

1. Home route paints one continuous wallpaper across sidebar and main content, with a live native heading, the real project utility row/composer, and any native suggestion cards exposed by the current Codex version.
2. Normal tasks show the selected image behind restrained gradients and translucent live content surfaces.
3. Sidebar, navigation, messages, approvals, project selector, attachments, composer, menus, hover, focus, and keyboard input remain native and interactive.
4. Decorative layers have `pointer-events: none`; no screenshot or raster UI is used as an overlay.
5. Route changes, renderer reloads, and ordinary refreshes reapply the current theme while the verified injector runs.
6. Official application signature and `app.asar` remain unchanged.
7. Restore removes live DOM/CSS, restores the two saved base-theme values, closes the CDP session after restart, and supports later reinstallation.

## Automated checks

- Shell and JavaScript syntax checks.
- Payload construction with bundled demo and an isolated custom theme.
- Reject unsupported theme config, unsafe image paths, invalid colors, oversized images, non-loopback WebSocket URLs, and unrecognized renderer targets.
- Exact install/restore round trip for the two TOML settings while preserving unrelated values.
- Empty `HOME` recovery.
- Official app and internal Node signature, Team ID, architecture, and version validation.
- Port collision selection and saved-port reuse.
- PID reuse protection through PID, start time, executable, script path, and command-line matching.
- Live verification after `Page.reload` returns version `1.5.8` and `pass: true`.
- Strict home verification requires a visible wallpaper composition region of at least 320×160, composer, sidebar, non-interactive decoration, and no horizontal overflow. Suggestion cards and the standalone project button are optional only when the current Codex host does not render them.
- Both Internet Angel preset IDs load the macOS overlay; Gothic, custom themes, and matching display names do not.
- On an Internet Angel task route, live verification requires a classified composer with the themed border and gradient. A visible Environment panel must also be classified and themed; an absent Environment panel remains optional.
- Visible Internet Angel sidebar New chat/profile/help controls must use their exact component markers. An open Add/slash palette must have a classified surface and every visible item classified; visible turn-navigation and scroll-to-bottom controls must also be classified.
- Overlay lifecycle tests cover composer, goal progress, context strips, Environment actions, sidebar/footer, Add palette, turn navigation, settings, terminal/summary, selection/diff, collaboration, right workspaces, bounded shell/portal observers, and complete cleanup on theme switch.

## Visual checks

- Home at normal desktop size: the subject stays clear of the text-safe area, text remains live, native cards are not clipped when present, and the merged project/composer surface does not overlap content.
- Narrower window: wallpaper cropping preserves the declared focus and safe area before essential controls are compressed.
- Task route: background remains atmospheric, messages and output panels keep high contrast, and the composer remains reachable.
- Internet Angel task route at normal width: composer, goal step, access/model/reasoning controls, Environment/Changes, messages, resource cards, menus, dialogs, and scrollbars use the cyan/blue/pink broadcast grammar.
- Internet Angel navigation pass: mode/search, New chat, utility/project/thread rows, section toggles, account/help footer, turn rail, scroll-to-bottom, and preview tooltip keep native geometry while using the Windows broadcast states.
- Internet Angel Add palette open: the full portal surface, sticky section headings, items, selected/hover state, icons, and scrollbar use the bespoke Windows palette instead of native charcoal styling.
- Conditional surface pass: settings, terminal/bottom drawer, output summary, side chat, selection actions, edited cards, reset toast, and subagent live/archive rows use their dedicated component grammar when present.
- Internet Angel task route at narrow width: composer actions and Environment actions remain visible, labels do not clip, panels do not overlap, and the document has no horizontal overflow.
- Theme isolation: switch from either Internet Angel preset to Gothic, confirm no `data-angel-component` attributes or Angel overlay styles remain, then restore the original preset.
- Task side panel: open and close the native thread panel twice, resize the window, and repeat; the toggle remains visible and clickable.
- Selected image contains no fake interface controls or raster text intended to impersonate Codex.
- Inspect sidebar selection, header, wallpaper edges, cards, project utility row, composer buttons, scrollbars, focus outlines, dialogs, and menus.

## Release signoff

- Run `tests/run-tests.sh` successfully.
- Install from a clean extracted copy with no global Node.js.
- Complete install → live verify → reload verify → restore → reinstall.
- Capture a real CDP screenshot and retain the verifier JSON.
- Confirm `codesign --verify --deep --strict` still succeeds for the official Codex app.
- Build ZIP and record SHA-256.
